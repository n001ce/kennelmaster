### From the mind of a former kennel employee, comes an application that simplifies the annotation process of daily tasks performed at animal care facilities.

# **Description**

**Kennel Manager** is a dashboard application where Managers, Employees, and even owners can sign up and track the daily happenings at their facility. There are three roles to choose from in version 1.0: 

    Manager
    Employee
    Owner

_Manager_ accounts give the user access to create, read, update, and delete tasks, animals, and users. Your head dashboard tracks all non completed tasks, so you know exactly who to track down.

_Employee_ accounts give the user access to create, read, update, and delete tasks and animals. Your dashboard tracks all of your non completed tasks for easier tracking.

_Owner_ accounts currently only give the user access to create, read, update, and delete animals. Your dashboard is limited to only viewing your dogs and their details.



# **How To Use**

When you click on the animal card you will be sent to that animals details page. From there you can edit the animals information, upload a photo, or delete the animal (Managers and Owners only).

The side navbar gives you access to index views of all the animals, tasks, and employees as well as a link back to the home dashboard or to logout.
